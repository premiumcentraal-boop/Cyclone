# Cyclone Tilt Glass — design principles

Status: **shipped** in the overlay in Mobile 5.0.0-alpha.43.dev1 and in the Cyclone app's Ask page and home task in
5.0.0-alpha.43.dev2. The design was agreed over 13 Overlay Studio rounds (plan 27, `Cyclone V5 plan/27-overlay-redesign.md`).
Physical Pixel 8 acceptance is UNVERIFIED.

This file is the reference for any new Cyclone surface: what the glass is, the rules it follows, the exact values,
and the ideas we tried and dropped. [Teal Matrix](CYCLONE_TEAL_MATRIX.md) is still the calm material for ordinary app
screens (lists, settings, Brain). Tilt Glass is for the surfaces where **Cyclone is acting or talking with you**: the
Ask bar, the task, the moments that need you, and the small status pills around them.

> One dark teal glass, lit by how you hold the phone. Words float on soft pills; only the things you press have a
> lit edge.

## 1. Principles

1. **One material.** Every task surface is the same dark teal glass (`Modifier.tiltGlass`). Hierarchy comes from size,
   position and type, never from a second material or a second palette.
2. **Light is physical and shared.** One light (`GlassLight`) lights every glass surface on screen, so they agree.
   The light comes from how the phone is tilted. The rim facing it catches a sharp line, the opposite rim a weaker
   one, as real glass refracts. At rest the light comes from the upper left.
3. **Sharp, not thick.** Edges are thin, crisp lines, never a wide soft highlight band. Panels get a narrower, sharper
   shine than small pills.
4. **Depth from the dots.** Fine halftone "fingerprint" dots hug the inner edge of large surfaces. On the lit side they
   are crisp and bright; on the far side they swell and fade, as if out of focus. They carry the depth; nothing else
   needs to.
5. **Words sit on veils.** Text never sits directly on the dots. It sits on a soft, edge-less, fully rounded veil pill,
   so it stays sharp and readable whatever the light does.
6. **Lit edges mean "press me".** Only round buttons, action capsules (approve, send, stop) and the plane pill get a
   lit rim. Text pills, chips and the Ask field do not. A lit edge is an affordance, not decoration.
7. **Everything answers a touch.** Every button flashes its rim and blooms a soft teal glow when pressed, about 0.75 s.
8. **Still unless it means something.** Nothing loops for looks. Motion is reserved for real state: a task working
   (spinner, ring, sliding progress), voice listening (the orb), light following your hand. No flicker, no idle
   shimmer, no streaming particles.
9. **Soft geometry.** Bars and pills are fully rounded capsules. Cards have 30 dp corners, inner veils 22 dp. Nothing
   has a hard corner.
10. **Show where the work is.** Real app logos (the current app in front) replace generic Cyclone branding wherever a
    task works in an app. Cyclone's own mark appears only when there is no app (idle, a fresh ask).
11. **The message is the hero.** When Cyclone needs you, the thing you are approving (the text to send, the action to
    take) is the largest, brightest element. Buttons follow it.
12. **Collapse, don't hide.** A surface shrinks through heights (card → island → notification) instead of vanishing;
    each smaller height keeps what is essential.
13. **Respect the owner's settings.** With Android animations off, the light rests and nothing animates. Every control
    has a content description.

## 2. The material

`Modifier.tiltGlass(cornerRadius, dots = true, thin = false, seeThrough = 1f)` in
`apps/mobile/.../ui/overlay/glass/TiltGlass.kt`. It draws, in order:

| Layer | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Body | vertical gradient `#10383E` → `#062228` (55%) → `#08282E`, alpha 0.94–0.95 × `seeThrough` |
| Sheen | linear teal `#83DBD7` from the light side, 16% × power, fading to clear by 45%, 6% returning on the far edge |
| Dots | hex grid, 4.3 dp step, band of `min(30 dp, 46% of height)` inside the rim, colour `#83DBD7`, alpha ≤ 0.85 |
| Hairline | 0.8 dp, `#A0E2DE` at 16% |
| Rim glow | 3.2 dp, `#83E6DE` at 30% × intensity × power (panels only; skipped when `thin`) |
| Rim line | 1.15 dp panels / 0.6 dp thin, `#F0FFFD`, up to 100% (80% thin) |

Shine along the rim (`GlassOptics.rimIntensity`), with `face = cos(normal − lightAngle)`:

- panels: `max(0,face)^5.5 + 0.7 · max(0,−face)^7.5`, a narrow sharp line plus a weaker opposite one;
- thin pills: `max(0,face)^3.2 + 0.7 · max(0,−face)^4.5`, a gentler, wider arc.

Dots (`GlassOptics.dotAlpha/dotRadius`), with `fall` 1 at the rim and 0 at the band's inner edge:

- lit side: `alpha ≈ (0.06 + 0.7 · lit^1.3 · power) · fall^0.8`, small crisp radius;
- far side: radius grows up to 1.9× and alpha drops by up to 45%, so they read as blurred.

The light (`FollowPhoneLight()` + `GlassOptics.lightFromGravity`):

- gravity sensor (accelerometer fallback) at `SENSOR_DELAY_UI`;
- the grip you start with is the baseline and re-centres slowly (0.4% per reading), so the light follows movement,
  not posture;
- tilt / 3.2 m/s² moves the light from rest (−0.45, −0.70), clamped to ±1, eased at 22% per reading;
- power = light distance clamped to 0.45–1, so the glass never goes fully dark;
- reads happen in the draw phase: a light change redraws, nothing recomposes;
- call `FollowPhoneLight()` once per screen that shows tilt glass. It rests when `ANIMATOR_DURATION_SCALE` is 0.

Variants:

| Variant | Call |
| --- | --- |
| Panel (card, owner card) | `tiltGlass(30.dp)` |
| Bar / island | `tiltGlass(33.dp)` at 66 dp high |
| Small pill (plane pill, outcome line) | `tiltGlass(17.dp, dots = false, thin = true)` at 34 dp high |
| Idle bubble | 58 × 50 dp oval, `tiltGlass(25.dp, dots = false, thin = true, seeThrough = 0.42–0.72)` |

## 3. Palette and type

| Token | Hex | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GlassInk` | `#E0F5F3` | titles, primary text, icons |
| `GlassMuted` | `#A6CCCA` | steps done, secondary lines |
| `GlassDim` | `#6F9896` | meta line |
| `GlassTeal` | `#83DBD7` | working, progress, current-app ring, cursor |
| `GlassWarm` | `#E9C78B` | needs you |
| Veil | `#04181D` at 30% | text pills (`veilPill()`) |
| Hero text | `#F2FFFD` | the approval message |
| Primary capsule text | `#052528` | on the teal primary button |

| Capsule button | 15 sp |
| Steps | 14.5 sp (current in ink, done in muted) |
| Plane word | 14 sp semibold |
| Status chip | 13.5 sp semibold |
| Meta line | 12 sp monospace, uppercase, 0.3 sp tracking |

## 4. Components (`ui/overlay/glass/GlassKit.kt`, `ui/overlay/OverlayGlassStack.kt`)

| Component | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `GlassRoundButton` | 46 dp (40 dp in headers) circle, faint white radial fill, `litRim()` whose bright point faces the light, `pressGlow` |
| `GlassCapsuleButton` | ≥ 44 dp capsule, radius 22, `litRim(cornerRadius = 22.dp)`, `pressGlow`; `primary` = teal fill |
| `veilPill()` | the edge-less text pill |
| `VoiceOrbButton` | a normal round button until listening; then a living teal orb: a lit sphere whose highlight faces the light, a 7 s swirl inside, and a soft 2.4 s breath of light that rises into the bar and fades to nothing before its edge (every glow is a radial gradient that reaches zero, so nothing has an edge); tight below. The mic turns dark (`#052528`) on the orb. One control in both states. Voice starts as the finger goes down: tap to talk, or hold ≥ 500 ms and let go to finish (push to talk); presses within 400 ms are one press, and a stop only counts after 800 ms of listening (`VoicePress`) |
| `GlassToolTile` / `GlassToolRow` | the tools drawer's controls: a tile is a lit capsule (radius 22) with the icon on a soft disc; a row is a lit round button (40 dp) and its label, and pressing the row flashes the button |
| `TiltGlassTheme` / `LocalTiltGlass` | the glass palette for Material text inside a glass surface; shared Teal Matrix controls (model picker, choice bar, menu trigger, text action) draw their glass version inside it: veils for trays, lit capsules for what you press |
| `AppLogo` / `AppLogoStack` | real launcher icons, round, dark 2 dp ring; current app 34 dp in front with a teal ring, earlier ones 28 dp at 82% overlapping by 9 dp (last 3 distinct apps, never Cyclone itself) |
| `GlassSpinner` | dotted ring, one turn per 1.6 s |
| `GlassProgress` | 3 dp line; sliding segment (1.4 s) when the length is unknown |
| `PlaneRow` | the one-word plane pill (*Screen*, *Background*, *Moving*, *Waiting*), right-aligned, with the outcome line beside it for 4 s when a move did not happen |
| `OverlayWorkCard` | panel: grabber (32 × 3 dp), inner veil (radius 22, 14 dp padding), header (logos · status chip · collapse), title, progress, last 3 steps, meta line |
| `WorkIsland` | 66 dp bar: current app logo in a turning ring (42 dp), two centred lines on a full-round veil, 2 dp progress along the bottom |
| `OverlayOwnerCard` | panel: where ("Send to **Sam** in WhatsApp"), then the message as hero, then lit capsules (Send, Change, Not now) |
| `GlassComposerBar` (in-app) / `OverlayAppleComposerBar` | 66 dp bar: + · Ask field on a veil filling the space · voice orb · send |
| Tools drawer (`OverlayToolsSheet`, in-app `InAppGlassSheet`) | a working card: panel glass (radius 30), the card's grabber, one inner veil (radius 22); tiles, rows and the model page on it |

## 5. Layout: the stack

Top to bottom, right-aligned small pill first:

```
                [ Background ]      plane pill, 34 dp
                    10 dp
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  (logos)  Working        ⌄   │    card, radius 30
│  Title                       │
│  ───── progress              │
│  ✓ step  ✓ step  ◌ step      │
│  STEP 3 OF 8 · CALENDAR → …  │
└──────────────────────────────┘
                    14 dp
(  +  (     Ask Cyclone     )  🎙  ➤ )   bar, 66 dp, radius 33
```

`OverlayStackGeometry`: `PILL_GAP_DP = 10`, `CARD_GAP_DP = 14`, `PILL_HEIGHT_DP = 34`, `CARD_RADIUS_DP = 30`,
`BAR_RADIUS_DP = 33`, `BAR_HEIGHT_DP = 66`. Keep new stacks on these numbers.

Heights, one gesture (drag down to go smaller):

1. **Card**: the full stack.
2. **Island**: the card folds into a bar the size of the Ask bar; the plane pill stays above it as its own capsule.
3. **Notification only**: the live notification carries the task; its *Show* action brings the island back.
4. **Idle**: the small see-through oval with Cyclone's mark.

When a task needs you, the owner card takes the card's place and rises, whatever height you were at.

## 6. Motion

| Motion | Timing |
| --- | --- |
| Press flash | rim to full in 130 ms, glow fades over 620 ms |
| Height / content swap | fade in 220 ms, out 140 ms (`AnimatedContent`) |
| Outcome line | fade 200 ms, shown 4 s |
| Drag | the stack follows the finger; release past the threshold commits the next height |
| Light | eased per sensor reading; no animation clock |
| Working | spinner 1.6 s/turn, island ring 1.4 s/turn, indeterminate progress 1.4 s |
| Voice | orb swirl 7 s, breathing 2.4 s, only while listening |

## 7. Words

- Status chips: *Working*, *Needs you*, *Done*, *Couldn't finish*.
- The plane pill is one word. Its reason is a sentence beside it, never silence: "Couldn't move WhatsApp: it stayed
  on your screen".
- Meta line: `STEP 3 OF 8 · CALENDAR → WHATSAPP`; drop parts you don't know.
- Island: what Cyclone does now, then the task with "· 3 of 8".
- Approvals: when the request quotes text, the quote is the message and the rest is the line above it.
- Copy lives in pure objects (`OverlayGlassCopy`) so it is unit-tested apart from the composables.

## 8. Tried and dropped

These came up in the design rounds and were rejected. Don't bring them back without a reason:

- **Circular fingerprint whorls** on the panels: too busy, inconsistent between surfaces.
- **A thick, light top edge**: read as plastic. Replaced by thin sharp rim lines.
- **Streaming or tunnelling dots** ("warp", infinite stream): too fast and distracting. Replaced by still dots whose
  focus follows the light.
- **Anything that loops for looks** (a pulsing Screen pill, shimmering pills): read as flicker.
- **Lit edges on everything**: the Ask field, text pills and chips lost their calm. Lit edges are for pressables.
- **A flat one-colour blur for voice**: looked dead next to a real orb. The orb has depth, swirl and light that rises
  upwards.
- **Cyclone logo and "Cyclone Mind" title on the card**: said nothing. The app logos say where the work is.
- **A one-tap stop square on the island**: too easy to hit by accident. The island keeps pause, and hold or double
  tap to stop.

## 9. Applying it to a new surface

1. Is Cyclone acting or talking with the owner here? Use Tilt Glass. Otherwise use Teal Matrix.
2. Start from `tiltGlass` with the variant in §2; don't draw your own glass.
3. Put every text block on a veil (`veilPill()` or the 22 dp inner veil).
4. Give lit rims only to things you press: `GlassRoundButton`, `GlassCapsuleButton`. Add `pressGlow` to any custom
   pressable.
5. Use the tokens in §3 and the geometry in §5; no new colours or radii without updating this file.
6. Show app logos when the surface is about an app.
7. Call `FollowPhoneLight()` once on the screen.
8. Animate only real state; check the screen with animations off.
9. Keep button actions going through Task Kit (`TaskCommands`), never a direct engine call.
10. Keep copy in a pure, tested object.

Performance notes: dot positions are computed once per size in `drawWithCache`; each frame only buckets dots by
alpha × radius (16 × 8 levels) and draws each bucket with one `drawPoints` call. Rim segments (260) are precomputed.
Keep new glass inside `drawWithCache` and read `GlassLight` only in the draw phase.

Prototype: the design rounds used the Overlay Studio web prototype. Iterate new designs there (or a similar HTML
mock) before building the APK.
