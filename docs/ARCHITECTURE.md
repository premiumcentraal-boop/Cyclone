# Cyclone architecture

Cyclone is an Android-first agent system. The phone owns perception, action policy, verification, learned routines and user-visible execution state. PC components extend the same phone runtime; they do not create a second control engine.

## Product components

### `apps/mobile`
The Android app (`com.cyclone.mobile`). It contains:

- Android Accessibility observation and action tooling
- the canonical `PhoneToolExecutor` mutation path
- Ask Cyclone task execution and model selection
- verification, recovery and learned app/routine knowledge
- Brain run history and sanitized downloadable diagnostics
- the persistent Aurora activation overlay
- the local gateway surface used by PC integrations

### `apps/device-gateway`
The PC-side device bridge. It handles device discovery/ADB forwarding and exposes a constrained local interface to Cyclone on the phone.

### `apps/pc-companion`
Cyclone One — the Windows glass: JPEG live view, human/AI handoff, and session tiles bound to `session_id`. It does not run a second phone-control engine.

### `tools/codex-phone-mcp` and `tools/cyclone-agent-mcp`
Constrained MCP adapters for external coding/agent clients. They route through Cyclone's gateway contract rather than exposing a generic shell.

## Runtime rule

The normal execution order is:

```text
compiled skill replay (goal + pageKey + sessionId + displayId)
→ known route / learned routine / open_app|intent landing / Fast Path LLM
→ a11y Page Card (elementIndex)
→ one screen-changing phone tool (or same-page form batch)
→ settle 300ms + fingerprint (+500/+1000 if Unchanged)
→ local tap verification (fingerprint is authority for ordinary taps)
→ recovery or next action
→ final result
```

A matching compiled skill hits without an LLM turn. Miss falls back to known route / Fast Path LLM / UI sub-agent. Vision is only on miss: empty accessibility tree or `perceptionMode=vision_escalate`. Unchanged after settle is `verified=false` and must not dispatch a second click channel. Consequential actions retain explicit approval boundaries. See [`V4_STAGE3_SKILL_COMPILER.md`](V4_STAGE3_SKILL_COMPILER.md) and [`V4_STAGE1_FASTPATH.md`](V4_STAGE1_FASTPATH.md).

### Task Kit (since 5.0.0-alpha.29)

Every task has exactly one engine (`TaskEngine`: Cyclone Mind, classic foreground agent, background workspace). Every
task button on every surface sends a typed `TaskCommand` through `TaskCommands`; the bus resolves the owning engine's
`TaskController`, which carries the command out or refuses with a reason, and records the outcome in the run trace
(`TASK_COMMAND`). Surfaces never call an engine directly. A contract test checks every engine against every command
and every button a surface can show. Structure plan: `Cyclone V5 plan/17-structure.md`.

### Learn (since 5.0.0-alpha.36)

Every Mind mission records a structural trail (`mind/learn/MissionTrail.kt`): each screen it read with all its
controls (labels and selectors filtered by `AtlasPrivacy`, text fields named by hint, never by value) and each action
with its before/after screen. One **Learn** press per run (`MissionLearning`, on the mission card, Brain → Outcomes
and Glass's run inspector through `learn.run`) turns the trail into the app knowledge store: screens, every control as
a learned action, and the same-app moves that worked, then projects it into the Atlas. The next run's screen reads
carry *Learned before* advice for known screens (`LearnedHints`); the Mind still acts through live refs and
re-observes. **Save skill** stores a completed run's goal as the owner's recipe (`market/OwnerSkills.kt`, "Your
skills"). Plan: `Cyclone V5 plan/20-app-mapping-build-plan.md`.

Since 5.0.0-alpha.37 the Mind also **runs from the map**: `mind/map/MindMap.kt` builds per-app routes from the same
learned knowledge (safe, reliable, non-stale moves only). The first screen read in a learned app carries the app's map
card, and the `go_to` tool walks a route through the ordinary act path, re-reading the screen after each move and
stopping at the first surprise; walks and surprises feed back into the store. The Lab variant knob `useMap` A/B-tests
it.

### Planes: the screen or a background screen (since 5.0.0-alpha.40)

A Mind mission works on one `TaskPlane` at a time: `Screen` (display 0) or `Background` (a Shizuku-backed private
virtual display). `runtime/plane/` holds the pure core — `PlaneSwitcher` (pause at a step boundary → move → verify →
grant, or restore and roll back; journaled in `FilePlaneJournal`, closed after a restart by `recover()`),
`PlanePolicy` (Automatic start and escalation signals), `AppPlaneCompat` (per app and version) and `BackgroundHealth`
with its `RecoveryLadder` — and `MissionPlanes`, the Android side: the mission's `MissionPlaneSession` implements the
Mind's `MindPlanes` hooks and a `PlanePort` over `WorkspaceRuntime` (`adopt` moves the app's task from display 0 into
the background display with `am display move-stack`; `handoff`/`resume` move it back and forth). Phone tools run inside
`MindStepGate`; after a move the toolbox is rebound to a `CycloneAgentEnvironment` for the new `ExecutionContext`, so
every action still goes through `PhoneToolExecutor` with its session and display. The pill (`ui/overlay/PlanePill.kt`),
and the task notification move tasks only with Task Kit (`MoveToBackground` / `MoveToForeground` /
`AllowBackground`). Plan: `Cyclone V5 plan/25-planes-background-foreground.md`.

### One map, grounded skills and routines (since 5.0.0-alpha.39)

A mapping pass records a Mind-style trail (`mapping/run/MappingTrailTap.kt`) and, when it ends, learns it into app
knowledge (`MappingLearning` → `MissionLearner`), so the map runs route on includes what missions walked; test-account
passes are learned at confidence 0.5 and `MindMap` prefers confirmed moves. Owner skills carry an anchor
(`market/SkillAnchor.kt`: app, way in, destination, finish steps) saved from the run's trail; `SkillGrounding` derives
health from the current map and writes the Mind's skill card, and a finished skill run re-grounds its anchor. Routines
run skills with `StepType.RUN_GROUNDED_SKILL` through `Marketplace.run` (the Ask entry); `RoutineGrounding` labels
routines grounded or scripted. `skills.list` (`GET /v1/devices/{id}/skills`) feeds Glass's Skills tab, the way on the
Taught map and the fleet. Plan: `Cyclone V5 plan/23-one-map-grounded-skills.md`.

### Mapping missions and the Glass Atlas (since 5.0.0-alpha.38)

`mapping.start` takes an **identity**: `own` (the owner's account, look only: a sign-in wall ends the pass as
`sign_in_needed`, and account/sign-in doors are refused) or `test` (sign-in screens allowed, secrets only through the
Secrets Card). Glass sends a mission budget (10 min / 30 min / 2 h → `maxElapsedMs`, `maxNewScreens`); the phone
enforces it. Mapper safety v2 (`mapping/crawl/MapperDoorRisk.kt`, called first by `ExistingGateMappingSafetyPort`)
refuses checkable controls and rows holding one, state-changing actions and security areas, on top of the GATE
classes. Glass derives **zones** client-side and deterministically from `atlas.get` (`apps/glass/src/maps/zones.ts`:
breadth-first from the entry, one zone per base page, at most 8) and draws the overview, zone views, the Coverage tab,
mission control (start sheet, live panel, report), the fleet (`#/apps`) and run replay. Glass still decides nothing.
Plan: `Cyclone V5 plan/22-glass-atlas-and-mapping-missions.md`.

### Cyclone Marketplace (since 5.0.0-alpha.35)

The phone's `market/` package is the one authority for the store: validated listings (data only; a recipe is a goal
template with typed inputs), what the owner added (`Cyclone Brain/Marketplace/installed.json`), suggestions from
installed apps, and the phone's connections (AI provider state, PC link; never keys). A recipe runs through the same
entry as a typed Ask (`OverlayChromeRuntime.submitRequest`), so the Mind keeps GATE, approvals and the Secrets Card;
runs are refused while the phone is busy or the owner has control. Glass (`#/market`) reads and changes it through
`market.*` gateway ops and shows this PC's MCP agents through the agent connector with fixed arguments
(`/v1/pc/connections`). Plan: `Cyclone V5 plan/19-marketplace.md`.

### Cyclone Lab (since 5.0.0-alpha.33)

Cyclone measures itself. The gateway's lab (`cyclone_device_gateway/lab/`) runs experiments — missions × variants ×
repetitions — on a paired phone: it prepares the phone through typed, allowlisted ADB probes (never a route, never the
model), starts a Mind mission with a variant over `lab.start`, plays the owner through Task Kit (it never approves and
never supplies a secret), and judges the result from the phone's real state, then restores every setting it changed.
Results carry the mission's metrics and redacted record; rates come with confidence intervals and A/B with an exact
test. Glass (`#/lab`) and the agent MCP (`phone_lab_*`) start and read experiments. Plan: `Cyclone V5 plan/18-cyclone-lab.md`.

### Owner Moments (since 5.0.0-alpha.31)

Whenever a task needs its owner, whichever engine runs it, the app derives one `OwnerMoment` (question, values
check-in, approval, secure input, hand-over) from the Mind inbox or the classic/background task state. The overlay, Ask
and the mission card render it with the one `CycloneOwnerCard`; the task notification shows the same buttons with an
inline reply. Every button is a Task Kit command. Buttons that act for the owner require an unlocked phone; secrets
stay on the Secrets Card.

### Cyclone Mind (foreground Ask, default since 5.0.0-alpha.25)

Foreground Ask requests run as a **mission** in `apps/mobile/.../mind/`: one model, one continuous conversation, native
tool calls (text envelope fallback), a working-time budget that excludes owner waits, and a journal after every turn so a
mission resumes after an interruption. The model chooses every action; the harness keeps the boundaries: every mutation
goes through `CycloneAgentEnvironment.act` → policy/GATE → `PhoneToolExecutor` → settle → verification, the new screen
is shown after each action, secret fields go only through the Secrets Card (`vault_fill`), approvals wait on the GATE
card or the mission's request card, and journals/diagnostics are redacted and never contain provider reasoning or
screenshots. Simple "open <app>" launches keep their fast path; background workspaces and owners who switch Cyclone Mind
off use the step agent above. Design and device test plan: `Cyclone V5 plan/16-cyclone-mind.md`.

Observe/act that can run in a workspace carry `sessionId` + `displayId`. Default-foreground is display 0 (`default-foreground`). Named workspace sessions never fall back to display 0; unknown session, display mismatch, and cross-session observation are rejected before mutation. Compiled skills carry the same session/display binding. See [`V4_STAGE2_SESSION_KERNEL.md`](V4_STAGE2_SESSION_KERNEL.md).

## Observability

Every completed or failed agent run should leave a durable trace. Brain presents recent runs and can export a compact text diagnostic containing model-visible context, decisions, tool requests/results, verification, failures and recovery events. Diagnostics must exclude credentials, raw typed secrets, screenshots/base64, full accessibility trees and hidden provider reasoning.

3. `AGENTS.md` and this documentation;
4. Git history and old release notes for historical context only.
