# Cyclone PC Companion

Tauri 2 + TypeScript desktop presentation shell for controlling one or many Cyclone phones.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Use mock fleets without a backend:

```text
http://localhost:1420/?mock=1
http://localhost:1420/?mock=2
http://localhost:1420/?mock=4
http://localhost:1420/?mock=8
http://localhost:1420/?mock=12
```

Run focused frontend logic tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Start the Tauri development shell after Rust/Tauri prerequisites are installed:

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

This package intentionally contains no ADB implementation, pairing cryptography, MCP configuration, Device Gateway backend implementation, or installer publishing logic.
