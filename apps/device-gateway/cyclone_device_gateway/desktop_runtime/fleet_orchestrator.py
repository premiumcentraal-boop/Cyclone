"""One command, many phones - on top of the Command Center, not beside it.

The Command Center (command/center.py) already does the hard, safety-critical part:
it hands a goal to one phone's own Mind (the phone's model and key, its GATE and Owner
Moments, its verification), keeps one task per phone, runs different phones in
parallel, waits - and resumes on its own - when a phone is locked, busy or offline, and
puts approvals in one inbox. "Done" is what the phone reports.

This module adds only what was missing above it:
  * a Mission: the per-phone tasks of one command, tracked and reported as one result;
  * dispatch: validate each named phone, then create one Command Center task per phone;
  * partial failure that does not discard the phones that did succeed;
  * cancel a mission (only that mission's tasks), stop fleet missions, emergency stop-all.

It never talks to a phone and never holds an API key. It cannot mutate a phone; it can only
ask the Command Center to create, watch or cancel a task.

Phase 1 changes (alpha.95.dev1):
  * Non-blocking dispatch: a nudge asks the Command Center loop to tick. tick() is not
    safe to run beside that loop (sweep() sits outside the CC lock), so the nudge wakes
    the loop when it is running and otherwise uses one coalesced worker. HTTP dispatch
    does not wait for the tick.
  * Scoped stop: stop_fleet_missions() cancels only tasks belonging to known fleet
    missions; stop_all() remains the emergency "cancel everything" path. Both are exposed
    in the API with distinct routes and distinct Glass labels.
  * SQLite store: missions are persisted in fleet_store.FleetStore (indexed, paginated,
    retention policy). Legacy missions.json is migrated automatically on first start.
    Age cleanup uses this orchestrator's clock and never deletes a mission that is still
    open in the Command Center.
  * Idempotency: client_request_id deduplication works across restarts and across
    parallel submits because the mission id is reserved and stored before any task is created.
  * Memory: only a recent cache is kept. mission() falls back to the store. missions()
    is paginated with a cursor.
